# TTS-DeckPack
A Pack Simulator for TTS that uses cards that already exist in a deck inside the pack.

This currently isn;t actuvly supported because I have moved to a version based on an API that does not rely on having an internal deck, but this version is posted so others can adapt it to thier own projects.
